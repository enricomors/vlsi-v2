# VLSI Design Problem
A refactored version of the VLSI Design project

# Usage

## Setup the virtual environment

This project is executed in a virtual environment created using `pipenv`, so the first thing to do will be to install
it:

```commandline
pip install pipenv
```

To activate the virtual environment, go inside the `/cdmo_vlsi` folder and run:

```commandline
pipenv shell
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you must install all the required packages for the project, which can be done
by running:

```commandline
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
